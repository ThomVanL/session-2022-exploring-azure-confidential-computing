# Session - Exploring Azure Confidential Computing

## Session description

_Some workloads you just can’t run in the cloud. That is typically the case in heavily regulated industries, where one needs to minimize security and privacy risks. But what if there was a way you could get the confidentiality guarantees of your private data center in Microsoft Azure? Microsoft Azure has several confidential computing offers that can keep data protected throughout its lifecycle and enhance the security posture of applications. By performing computations in hardware-based trusted execution environments, we can now protect and isolate code and data. Confidential computing is a complex subject; however, Microsoft and its partners are making tremendous strides in lowering the complexity, ensuring it becomes more accessible. In this session, we will look at when (and how) you can use the core components of Azure Confidential Computing._
